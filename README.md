> A Discord.js moderation bot powered by Node.js, ByrnesBot offers a moderation solution for Discord Servers created for the Byrnes/Lever Communities at Clemson University.

> Originally created by /new-zelind and /MayorMonty in Summer 2019, ByrnesBot is a reproduction and overhaul of [LeverBot](https://github.com/new-zelind/LeverBot). It offers more streamlined code, more efficient processing, as well as a few new features.

# Capabilities
- Auto-Verification of users upon server entry.
- Message logging with timestamps. Also logs message edits, deletions, server ban additions/removals, and more.
- Timeout and soft-ban capabilites.
- Many functional commands for things residents might need.
- Games for residents and RAs to play, as well as win/loss recording (for bragging rights).
- Ease of use for all, no matter how long you've been on Discord!
- Try sending `$help` to see what the bot can do!
